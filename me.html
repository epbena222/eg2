 Hi im egamer but you can just call me E, I have been making youtube videos for about four months as a hobby, i wanted to do this because i love video games and i love to share my gaming experince. so i thought what if instead of just talking about it what if i recorded my games and then tried to show a new perspective on them. eventually i gathered some money built a computer and started to record these videos and it created the Eg2 channel.
